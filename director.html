We were and are still pioneer and exclusive after Mohan Lal Sukhadiya University, Udaipur in Rajasthan to provide Bacholar of arts (B.A.) in all streams including fine arts.<br>
We are systemically and strategically recruiting dedicated and highly qualified faculty and developing our network to increase our presence in the fields of Law, Computer science, Arts, Commerce & Science. Our efforts will not go unnoticed and as we were bestowed awarded with many awards in recognition over a journey of these years .<br>
With our academic foundation firmly grounded in excellence, we are now becoming more cautious in implementing course curriculum, teaching programs and out reach programs. Hence, at R.N.T. we are constantly challenging ourselves to integrate with the need of our students & their future. Nothing at R.N.T. is taken for granted. Nothing is accepted simply because of the past. Evaluation, of teaching courses is done on continuous cycle to ensure that the education given is the best and absolutely relevant to the need and to challenging environment. <br>
I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to each and every one of our stake holders, society members, academic partners, alumni, faculty members and students who have believed in us and supported us through our journey of thirteen years to become a reputed institute. While penning this note, as I reflect on the year gone by, It gives me great pleasure to recount milestones of Deeksha Creations Society that have equipped us to remain at the forefront of the world of education.<br><br>
<b> Wishing you all the very best for all future endeavors.</b>
